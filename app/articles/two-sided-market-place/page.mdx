## Historical Emergence of Two‑Sided Platforms

Two‑sided marketplaces connect suppliers and consumers through a single platform.  

**Sharetribe** notes that this model underpins many leading platforms: Airbnb pairs hosts with travellers, Uber matches drivers with passengers, e‑commerce sites such as Amazon and eBay link sellers with buyers, and freelance marketplaces like Upwork, Fiverr and Toptal connect independent professionals with clients【384549514692628†L72-L132】.  

Marketplaces scale efficiently as more participants join because the platform charges commissions only when transactions occur【384549514692628†L76-L88】.  

PwC estimates the global sharing economy could surpass **USD 335 billion by 2025**【384549514692628†L104-L108】.

## Why Markets Emerge

Two‑sided platforms have historically flourished in fragmented industries where providers lack the scale or resources to reach customers on their own.  

Examples include hospitality (Airbnb), transportation (Uber) and freelance services (Upwork).  

These platforms aggregate supply and demand and provide standardised processes (payments, reviews, dispute resolution) that independent providers could not easily offer.  

For drivers, hosts or freelancers, joining a marketplace allows them to monetise idle capacity without the overhead of operating a full business.

## Challenges Faced by Small Accounting Firms

The accounting sector is similarly fragmented.  Many small firms and independent contractors struggle with **capital and staffing constraints**, making it difficult to invest in technology, hire talent or expand service offerings【339626276278448†L129-L180】.  They often rely on referrals and partnerships to grow and may feel pressured to join larger networks or private‑equity roll‑ups【705499794430290†L230-L325】.  This environment discourages experimentation and limits scalability.

## Advontier’s Two‑Sided Marketplace Vision

Advontier aims to apply the two‑sided model to professional services by connecting **small accounting firms and independent professionals** with a **centralised pool of processing and bookkeeping resources**.  In this model:

- **Firms and contractors** sign up to manage their practice through a multi‑tenant platform, with modules for compliance, payroll, KYC/AML, client management and AI‑assisted research.
- **A shared service hub** delivers on‑demand processing, bookkeeping and BPO resources, billed on a consumption basis.  This allows professionals to scale operations without hiring full‑time staff or joining a larger firm.
- The platform coordinates engagements, resource requests and service delivery, ensuring that independent specialists can operate at scale while maintaining their own branding.

By combining marketplace dynamics with a robust practice‑management engine, Advontier seeks to empower professionals to compete with larger firms, improve capacity utilisation and create new revenue streams.
