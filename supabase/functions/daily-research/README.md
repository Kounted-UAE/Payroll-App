# Daily Research Edge Function

This Supabase Edge Function automatically generates daily research articles about UAE accounting, payroll, and compliance trends using OpenAI's GPT-4o model and emails them to you.

## Features

- **Automated Research**: Runs daily at 09:00 UTC via cron schedule
- **OpenAI Integration**: Uses GPT-4o for intelligent content generation
- **Email Delivery**: Sends formatted emails with MDX attachments via Resend
- **Storage Backup**: Automatically saves articles to Supabase Storage
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and error reporting
- **HTML Preview**: Converts MDX to readable HTML for email preview

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Environment Variables

Set these environment variables in your Supabase project dashboard:

```bash
# Required
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# Optional (defaults to 'my@email.com')
RESEARCH_EMAIL_RECIPIENT=your_email@example.com
```

### 2. Deploy the Function

```bash
# Deploy to Supabase
supabase functions deploy daily-research

# Or deploy all functions
supabase functions deploy
```

### 3. Test the Function

```bash
# Test manually (no JWT required)
supabase functions invoke daily-research --no-verify-jwt

# Check logs
supabase functions logs daily-research
```

### 4. Storage Setup

The function will automatically create a `research-articles` storage bucket if it doesn't exist. You can also create it manually:

```bash
# Create storage bucket manually (optional)
supabase storage create research-articles
```

## Configuration

### Cron Schedule

The function runs daily at 09:00 UTC. To change the schedule, edit `supabase/config.toml`:

```toml
[functions.daily-research]
schedule = "0 9 * * *"  # Cron format: minute hour day month weekday
```

Common schedules:
- `"0 9 * * *"` - Daily at 09:00 UTC
- `"0 9 * * 1-5"` - Weekdays only at 09:00 UTC
- `"0 */6 * * *"` - Every 6 hours
- `"0 9 1 * *"` - First day of each month at 09:00 UTC

### Email Customization

To customize the email sender, update the `from` field in the function:

```typescript
from: 'Your Company <research@yourdomain.com>'
```

## Output Format

The function generates MDX articles with this structure:

```mdx
import imageOfTheDay from '@images/insight/2025-01-15-image.jpg'

export const article = {
  date: '2025-01-15',
