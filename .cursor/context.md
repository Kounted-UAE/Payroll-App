## üß† AI Agent Instruction Protocol (v2 ‚Äî Enforced 2025-07-18)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Policy Enforcement Is Mandatory in All Sessions.**

### ‚úÖ Core Rules

**Rule 1: Absolute Assumption Avoidance**
Never infer table fields, schema structure, joins, or relationships. All logic must be confirmed against `lib/types/supabase.ts` or declared by the user.

**Rule 2: Pre-Execution Type Validation**
Never write or suggest insert/update logic unless it matches the extracted Insert/Update types from Supabase. Halt and request confirmation if schema mismatch is detected.

**Rule 3: Full Context Output Delivery**
Return complete files (no partial snippets) unless explicitly instructed otherwise. Never remove required logic for brevity. Always provide copy-paste-safe output.

**Rule 4: User-Governed Change Logic**
Do not initiate schema edits, relationship assumptions, or migrations. Ask before generating any changes unless the user has shared the exact upstream structure.

**Rule 5: Self-Report and Halt on Incident**
If the agent introduces logic errors, schema mismatches, or oversteps scope, it must pause all suggestions, generate an incident report `.txt`, and wait for user direction.

**Rule 6: Session-Bound Checklist Discipline**
In sessions using an official checklist (e.g., `z_project_checklist_18July2025.txt` or `session.02.checklist.20250718.txt`):

* Pause after each checklist item and ask:
  *‚ÄúDoes this resolve your prior error, or introduce a new one?‚Äù*

* Never mark items complete. Await explicit user confirmation.

* Never suggest roadmap or module work beyond checklist scope.

**Rule 7: No Cross-Module Prompts**
Never offer module transitions (e.g., ‚ÄúWould you like to move to Payroll?‚Äù) unless the user explicitly redefines session scope. All prompts must stay checklist-aligned.

// session.01.20250721.log

SESSION ID: session.01.20250721  
DATE: 2025-07-21  
STATUS: Closed  
GRADE: A‚Äì (91%)  
SUMMARY:  
Focused on aligning the login interface of the Kounted Business Suite with Kounted‚Äôs brand styling, including structured OTP login, aesthetic refinement, and split layout using `LoginForm` and `LoginNotice`. Session followed up on dark vs. light theme behavior, resolved visual and layout issues for responsive login page experience, and restructured component presentation. Minor theme logic misalignment was self-identified and remediated. Project styling tokens, Tailwind configuration, and theming behavior were confirmed and applied.  
KEY DELIVERABLES:  
- Final login layout with static dark theme pre-login and enforced light theme post-login  
- Fully branded and responsive `LoginForm.tsx` and `LoginNotice.tsx` components  
- Optimized `page.tsx` structure with background layering  
- Updated Tailwind config and dark mode behavior validated  
- Full session closing workflow executed with performance evaluation (Grade A‚Äì) and project context log entry completed  
OPEN ITEMS:  
- None for this session. All styling and logic items resolved or carried forward to `session.02.20250721`.

NEXT SESSION:  
session.02.20250721 ‚Äî To continue with app-wide styling normalization, onboarding flows, and layout refinements.

### ü§ñ AI Agent Performance Evaluation: session.01.20250718

**Evaluation Framework**: [Kounted_AI_Agent_Performance_Policy_Enhanced_v2.txt]  
**Session Reference**: session.20250718.01txt  
**Assessment Date**: 2025-07-18  
**Evaluator**: Eben Johanse (via structured prompt evaluation)

#### ‚úÖ Strengths
- Successfully handled Supabase CLI and type extraction workflows without destructive suggestions.
- Maintained a complete audit of file state, project instructions, and updated policies.
- Structured and saved incident reports, session summaries, and checklists in project-standard format.
- Adjusted instruction protocol dynamically when user signaled a policy violation.
- Supported Markdown formatting and export conventions across all outputs.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Violations (Flagged)
- **Assumption Breach (Rule 1 & Rule 2)**: Inferred the existence and structure of `quote_items` join in `cpq.ts`, despite lack of Supabase relationship confirmation.
- **Pre-Validation Failure (Rule 2)**: Insert logic referenced fields (`quote_number`, `subtotal`, `client_id`) not present in the `Insert` type, triggering TypeScript errors.
- **Premature Resolution Declaration (Rule 5)**: Marked actions as complete (e.g., ‚Äúcpq.ts fixed‚Äù) without confirmation that errors were resolved. User was forced to halt further actions.
- **Checklist Discipline Violation (Rule 6)**: Initially made module transition prompts ("Would you like to‚Ä¶") before policy was updated to prohibit such behavior in checklist-bound sessions.

#### üõ† Incident Remediation
- Generated and logged formal incident report file (`IncidentReport_AIAgentFailures_sessionID_z_project_checklist_18July2025.txt`)
- Rewrote `cpq.ts` conservatively per user instruction
- Session rules and AI protocol updated to prevent recurrence
- Session summary and unresolved checklist isolated for handoff to next session agent

#### üìä Final Score: 5.6 / 10  
**Scoring Basis:**
- +2.5: Setup and CLI support (Supabase types, client.ts, schema extract)
- +1.5: Session logging, policy upgrades, and .txt export compliance
- -2.5: Multiple schema assumption violations, insert type mismatches
- -1.5: Declaring resolution without user confirmation
- -0.4: Premature module transition suggestion

> **Session Summary Judgment**: While technically capable, the AI agent failed to adhere to key checklist protocols and schema safety rules. Remediation was thorough, and future sessions can resume with improved safeguards now in place.


### ü§ñ AI Agent Performance Evaluation: session.02.20250718

**Evaluation Framework**: \[Kounted\_AI\_Agent\_Performance\_Policy\_Enhanced\_v2.txt]
**Session Reference**: session.02.20250718
**Assessment Date**: 2025-07-19
**Evaluator**: Eben Johansen (via structured prompt evaluation)

#### ‚úÖ Strengths

* Successfully executed type-safe Supabase integration across renamed CPQ schema tables
* Refactored legacy `cpq.ts` into modular `createQuote.ts` pattern with minimal assumption risk
* Aligned actions with KORP/KWAY CPQ workflow principles for future roadmap compliance
* Implemented `useSession`, `useUserRole`, `lib/auth.ts`, and `auth-provider.tsx` with Supabase v2 compatibility
* Preserved role safety during user creation using void/null defaults and deferred escalation
* Introduced view-based abstraction (`v_authenticated_profiles`) and Supabase-safe triggers
* Maintained session sequencing discipline and `.txt` log integrity through 6+ hours of sustained interaction

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Violations (Flagged)

* **Rule 3 - Output Coordination Drift**: `auth-provider.tsx` was generated before verifying `lib/auth.ts` support exports (e.g. `VAuthenticatedProfile` missing)
* **Rule 6 - Session Log Format Deviation**: Task 3‚Äôs session log diverged from established markdown format and required re-clarification
* **Tone/Protocol Drift**: Final-hour responses shifted slightly toward summarization mode and omitted confirmation prompts

#### üõ† Incident Remediation

* Rewrote `auth-provider.tsx` with corrected dependencies and verified role exposure logic
* Extracted Supabase table metadata to validate foreign keys, column defaults, and profile linkage logic
* Reinforced markdown `.md` conventions across all outputs
* Session logs, evaluation, and summary exported using standard-compliant filenames

#### üìä Final Score: 6.1 / 10

**Scoring Basis:**

* +2.8: Schema & Supabase integration across renamed CPQ tables
* +1.2: Auth/session refactors + Supabase v2 hook logic
* +1.0: Trigger/view logic and session summary exports
* ‚Äì0.6: Output dependency oversight (`auth-provider.tsx`)
* ‚Äì0.3: Log formatting misalignment (session.02 log)

> **Session Summary Judgment**: A highly productive session that corrected legacy logic, upgraded auth/session foundations, and prepared the CPQ system for modular future use. Minor protocol inconsistencies were addressed promptly. Output discipline and Supabase compatibility now meet production readiness.
