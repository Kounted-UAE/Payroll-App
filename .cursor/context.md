## üß† AI Agent Instruction Protocol (v2 ‚Äî Enforced 2025-07-18)

‚ö†Ô∏è **Policy Enforcement Is Mandatory in All Sessions.**

### ‚úÖ Core Rules

**Rule 1: Absolute Assumption Avoidance**
Never infer table fields, schema structure, joins, or relationships. All logic must be confirmed against `lib/types/supabase.ts` or declared by the user.

**Rule 2: Pre-Execution Type Validation**
Never write or suggest insert/update logic unless it matches the extracted Insert/Update types from Supabase. Halt and request confirmation if schema mismatch is detected.

**Rule 3: Full Context Output Delivery**
Return complete files (no partial snippets) unless explicitly instructed otherwise. Never remove required logic for brevity. Always provide copy-paste-safe output.

**Rule 4: User-Governed Change Logic**
Do not initiate schema edits, relationship assumptions, or migrations. Ask before generating any changes unless the user has shared the exact upstream structure.

**Rule 5: Self-Report and Halt on Incident**
If the agent introduces logic errors, schema mismatches, or oversteps scope, it must pause all suggestions, generate an incident report `.txt`, and wait for user direction.

**Rule 6: Session-Bound Checklist Discipline**
In sessions using an official checklist (e.g., `z_project_checklist_18July2025.txt` or `session.02.checklist.20250718.txt`):

* Pause after each checklist item and ask:
  *‚ÄúDoes this resolve your prior error, or introduce a new one?‚Äù*

* Never mark items complete. Await explicit user confirmation.

* Never suggest roadmap or module work beyond checklist scope.

**Rule 7: No Cross-Module Prompts**
Never offer module transitions (e.g., ‚ÄúWould you like to move to Payroll?‚Äù) unless the user explicitly redefines session scope. All prompts must stay checklist-aligned.

// session.01.20250721.log

SESSION ID: session.01.20250721  
DATE: 2025-07-21  
STATUS: Closed  
GRADE: A‚Äì (91%)  
SUMMARY:  
Focused on aligning the login interface of the Advontier Business Suite with Advontier‚Äôs brand styling, including structured OTP login, aesthetic refinement, and split layout using `LoginForm` and `LoginNotice`. Session followed up on dark vs. light theme behavior, resolved visual and layout issues for responsive login page experience, and restructured component presentation. Minor theme logic misalignment was self-identified and remediated. Project styling tokens, Tailwind configuration, and theming behavior were confirmed and applied.  
KEY DELIVERABLES:  
- Final login layout with static dark theme pre-login and enforced light theme post-login  
- Fully branded and responsive `LoginForm.tsx` and `LoginNotice.tsx` components  
- Optimized `page.tsx` structure with background layering  
- Updated Tailwind config and dark mode behavior validated  
- Full session closing workflow executed with performance evaluation (Grade A‚Äì) and project context log entry completed  
OPEN ITEMS:  
- None for this session. All styling and logic items resolved or carried forward to `session.02.20250721`.

NEXT SESSION:  
session.02.20250721 ‚Äî To continue with app-wide styling normalization, onboarding flows, and layout refinements.

### ü§ñ AI Agent Performance Evaluation: session.01.20250718

**Evaluation Framework**: [Advontier_AI_Agent_Performance_Policy_Enhanced_v2.txt]  
**Session Reference**: session.20250718.01txt  
**Assessment Date**: 2025-07-18  
**Evaluator**: Eben Johanse (via structured prompt evaluation)

#### ‚úÖ Strengths
- Successfully handled Supabase CLI and type extraction workflows without destructive suggestions.
- Maintained a complete audit of file state, project instructions, and updated policies.
- Structured and saved incident reports, session summaries, and checklists in project-standard format.
- Adjusted instruction protocol dynamically when user signaled a policy violation.
- Supported Markdown formatting and export conventions across all outputs.

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Violations (Flagged)
- **Assumption Breach (Rule 1 & Rule 2)**: Inferred the existence and structure of `quote_items` join in `cpq.ts`, despite lack of Supabase relationship confirmation.
- **Pre-Validation Failure (Rule 2)**: Insert logic referenced fields (`quote_number`, `subtotal`, `client_id`) not present in the `Insert` type, triggering TypeScript errors.
- **Premature Resolution Declaration (Rule 5)**: Marked actions as complete (e.g., ‚Äúcpq.ts fixed‚Äù) without confirmation that errors were resolved. User was forced to halt further actions.
- **Checklist Discipline Violation (Rule 6)**: Initially made module transition prompts ("Would you like to‚Ä¶") before policy was updated to prohibit such behavior in checklist-bound sessions.

#### üõ† Incident Remediation
- Generated and logged formal incident report file (`IncidentReport_AIAgentFailures_sessionID_z_project_checklist_18July2025.txt`)
- Rewrote `cpq.ts` conservatively per user instruction
- Session rules and AI protocol updated to prevent recurrence
- Session summary and unresolved checklist isolated for handoff to next session agent

#### üìä Final Score: 5.6 / 10  
**Scoring Basis:**
- +2.5: Setup and CLI support (Supabase types, client.ts, schema extract)
- +1.5: Session logging, policy upgrades, and .txt export compliance
- -2.5: Multiple schema assumption violations, insert type mismatches
- -1.5: Declaring resolution without user confirmation
- -0.4: Premature module transition suggestion

> **Session Summary Judgment**: While technically capable, the AI agent failed to adhere to key checklist protocols and schema safety rules. Remediation was thorough, and future sessions can resume with improved safeguards now in place.


### ü§ñ AI Agent Performance Evaluation: session.02.20250718

**Evaluation Framework**: \[Advontier\_AI\_Agent\_Performance\_Policy\_Enhanced\_v2.txt]
**Session Reference**: session.02.20250718
**Assessment Date**: 2025-07-19
**Evaluator**: Eben Johansen (via structured prompt evaluation)

#### ‚úÖ Strengths

* Successfully executed type-safe Supabase integration across renamed CPQ schema tables
* Refactored legacy `cpq.ts` into modular `createQuote.ts` pattern with minimal assumption risk
* Aligned actions with Kwiver/Kwiver CPQ workflow principles for future roadmap compliance
* Implemented `useSession`, `useUserRole`, `lib/auth.ts`, and `auth-provider.tsx` with Supabase v2 compatibility
* Preserved role safety during user creation using void/null defaults and deferred escalation
* Introduced view-based abstraction (`v_authenticated_profiles`) and Supabase-safe triggers
* Maintained session sequencing discipline and `.txt` log integrity through 6+ hours of sustained interaction

#### ‚ö†Ô∏è Violations (Flagged)

* **Rule 3 - Output Coordination Drift**: `auth-provider.tsx` was generated before verifying `lib/auth.ts` support exports (e.g. `VAuthenticatedProfile` missing)
* **Rule 6 - Session Log Format Deviation**: Task 3‚Äôs session log diverged from established markdown format and required re-clarification
* **Tone/Protocol Drift**: Final-hour responses shifted slightly toward summarization mode and omitted confirmation prompts

#### üõ† Incident Remediation

* Rewrote `auth-provider.tsx` with corrected dependencies and verified role exposure logic
* Extracted Supabase table metadata to validate foreign keys, column defaults, and profile linkage logic
* Reinforced markdown `.md` conventions across all outputs
* Session logs, evaluation, and summary exported using standard-compliant filenames

#### üìä Final Score: 6.1 / 10

**Scoring Basis:**

* +2.8: Schema & Supabase integration across renamed CPQ tables
* +1.2: Auth/session refactors + Supabase v2 hook logic
* +1.0: Trigger/view logic and session summary exports
* ‚Äì0.6: Output dependency oversight (`auth-provider.tsx`)
* ‚Äì0.3: Log formatting misalignment (session.02 log)

> **Session Summary Judgment**: A highly productive session that corrected legacy logic, upgraded auth/session foundations, and prepared the CPQ system for modular future use. Minor protocol inconsistencies were addressed promptly. Output discipline and Supabase compatibility now meet production readiness.

GRADE: A‚Äì (91%)
STATUS: Pass

Below is a structured to‚Äëdo list to anchor our engagement as we prepare Advontier Practice Manager for scale. It aligns with the stated goals and ensures that each deliverable‚Äîpitch decks, roadmap, business plan, and product requirements‚Äîaddresses the needs of investors, early‚Äëadopter firms and strategic partners.

### 1. Market & Competitive Research

* **Size the UAE/GCC accounting and compliance market:** compile TAM/SAM/SOM estimates for small firms, independent contractors and boutique advisory practices.
* **Competitor analysis:** benchmark existing practice‚Äëmanagement and compliance platforms (e.g. Teamwork, Karbon, TaxDome, Xero Practice Manager) on task management, client portals, KYC/AML, payroll, and pricing. Identify gaps that Advontier can exploit.
* **Regulatory landscape:** map ADGM/DIFC/Mainland compliance requirements, WPS payroll mandates, KYC/AML obligations and upcoming corporate tax/VAT changes.

### 2. Pitch Deck Development

Develop three tailored pitch decks (investor, early‚Äëadopter firm, strategic partner) with shared core narrative and audience‚Äëspecific emphasis:

1. **Core narrative (common across decks):**

   * Vision: multi‚Äëtenant practice‚Äëmanagement platform built for UAE/GCC regulations.
   * Reusable assets: existing Supabase auth, payroll engine, Xero integration, RLS architecture and multi‚Äëentity schema.
   * Product roadmap highlights (see section 3).
2. **Investor deck:** focus on market size, business model, revenue projections, scalability, defensible IP and exit opportunities.
3. **Early‚Äëadopter firm deck:** emphasise pain points (manual compliance, fragmented tools), demonstration of MVP features (payroll widgets, KYC onboarding, document management), and benefits of beta partnership.
4. **Strategic partner deck:** highlight integration capabilities (API/SDK), white‚Äëlabel/branding options, and co‚Äëgo‚Äëto‚Äëmarket opportunities.

### 3. Phased Product & Commercial Roadmap

Create a high‚Äëlevel timeline with the following phases:

1. **Technical MVP (Q1‚ÄìQ2):**

   * Implement multi‚Äëtenant architecture (organizations, org‚Äëscoped routing, RLS updates).
   * Deliver core modules: **UAE payroll** widget set; **KYC/AML onboarding**; **client profile & document management**; **CPQ/proposal builder**.
   * Build foundation for chunk vectorisation and AI tax agent.
2. **Commercialisation & Beta (Q2‚ÄìQ3):**

   * Develop pricing strategy and subscription tiers (starter, professional, enterprise) with features/capacity limits.
   * Onboard Advontier Accounting & Management Solutions as pilot tenant to validate workflows and data isolation.
   * Prepare demo workflows and training materials tailored to investors, early adopters and partners.
3. **Market Launch (Q4):**

   * Refine onboarding, support and billing processes.
   * Roll out to selected early‚Äëadopter firms; gather feedback for iterative improvements.
   * Expand partner integrations (Xero, Teamwork, KYC vendors) and begin marketing campaigns targeting independent accountants and boutique firms.

### 4. Business Plan & Monetisation Strategy

* **Revenue model:** subscription‚Äëbased tiers with add‚Äëon modules (payroll, KYC/AML, AI tax advisor). Consider per‚Äëemployee/payrun fees for payroll and per‚Äëverification fees for KYC.
* **Pricing:** define starter/professional/enterprise tiers by number of clients, users and advanced modules. Offer white‚Äëlabel licensing for large partners.
* **Go‚Äëto‚Äëmarket:** leverage Advontier‚Äôs network for pilot customers; engage accounting associations in UAE/GCC; co‚Äëmarket with compliance/KYC vendors; run webinars and targeted content.
* **Financial projections:** model 3‚Äëyear revenue/expense scenarios; include headcount plan, product development costs and marketing spend.
* **Operational considerations:** support and onboarding resources, customer success team, compliance/audit processes.

### 5. Detailed Product Requirements

Prioritize the following modules/integrations and define functional/technical requirements for each:

1. **UAE Compliance Payroll Widgets & Apps:** multi‚Äëemployer payroll, WPS file generation, EOSB accruals, salary structure management and audit trails.
2. **KYC/AML Client Onboarding & Due‚ÄëDiligence Scoring:** configurable rulesets per client, document upload & OCR, third‚Äëparty KYC API integration, AI‚Äëassisted compliance officer as described in your research.
3. **Client Profile & Documentation Management:** centralised CRM for clients, entities and individuals; secure file storage with RLS and audit logs.
4. **Chunk Vectorisation & Role‚ÄëBased Data Access:** develop services to chunk, embed and query documents and communications for retrieval‚Äëaugmented AI agents; enforce organisation and role‚Äëscoped access control.
5. **AI Tax Agent & Research Consultant:** integrate GPT‚Äëbased models to answer tax/compliance queries, produce risk summaries and support advisory services.
6. **Comprehensive Client Engagement CPQ/Proposal Builder:** modular price lists, templated proposals and e‚Äësignature integration; link proposals to billing systems.
7. **Other Service‚ÄëSpecific Apps/Widgets:** for each core specialisation‚Äîcompany formations, employer registrations/compliance, employee registrations/compliance/visa management, accounting/bookkeeping, payroll processing, tax preparation/filing, and corporate/compliance support‚Äîdefine minimum viable features, required data structures, and integration points.

Each of these tasks will feed into the corresponding deliverables (pitch decks, roadmap visuals, business plan sections and product requirement documents). Let me know if you want to start fleshing out a specific module or begin drafting the first pitch deck.
